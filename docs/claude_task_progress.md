| 0.2  | done   | 2026-04-29 | Created docs/claude_task_progress.yaml and docs/claude_task_progress.md. |
| 0.3  | done   | 2026-04-29 | git init, git identity set. Created README.md, .gitignore, .env.example. No commit. |
| 1.1  | done   | 2026-04-29 | Created package skeleton: services/api/app/, services/worker/app/, libs/common/, libs/asr_adapter/, libs/audio_pipeline/, tests/. PYTHONPATH import checks passed. |
| 1.2  | done   | 2026-04-29 | Created pyproject.toml with Cut A deps. Venv at .venv/. Third-party and project-module imports verified. pytest --collect-only exits with code 5 (no tests, no import errors). |
| 1.3  | done   | 2026-04-29 | Created libs/common/settings.py (pydantic-settings BaseSettings). 18 settings unit tests pass. Provider normalized/validated; upload_limit_bytes validated >0; cache behavior verified. No FastAPI/Celery/DB/storage touched. |
| 1.4  | done   | 2026-04-29 | FastAPI skeleton: /health, /ready placeholder, safe unhandled-exception JSON handler. 6 API tests pass. |
| 1.5  | done   | 2026-04-29 | Celery skeleton: celery_app.py + debug.ping task. 3 worker tests pass. No Redis required. |
| 1.6  | blocked | 2026-04-29 | Created infra/compose/docker-compose.yml and infra/compose/Dockerfile.backend for exactly api, worker, postgres, redis, minio with named volumes. Static YAML validation passed and no later-cut services found. Runtime verification blocked because Docker Compose is unavailable on datamove1; external Docker Compose verification is still pending. Pytest is green after switching API tests away from the local TestClient deadlock: API 6 passed, libs 18 passed, worker 3 passed, full suite 27 passed. |
