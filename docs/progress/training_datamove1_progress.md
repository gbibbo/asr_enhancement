# Training Task Progress

Branch: feature/training-datamove1-v1
Integration branch: demo-rp5-v1
Current cut: T1 (gate complete — T0 through T1.3 all done)
Current phase: Phase 1
Current task: Task T2.1

## Completed

- T0.1: inspected datamove1 repository state. Repo root `/mnt/fast/nobackup/users/gb0048/asr_enhancement`, remote `git@github.com:gbibbo/asr_enhancement.git`, working tree clean, branch on `feature/training-datamove1-v1`.
- T0.2: training Claude profile activated on `feature/training-datamove1-v1` (commit `243ed48`). Root `CLAUDE.md` mirrors `docs/profiles/CLAUDE.training.md`; `.gitattributes` declares `CLAUDE.md merge=ours`; local `merge.ours.driver` configured to `true`.
- T0.3: created independent training trackers `docs/progress/training_datamove1_progress.{md,yaml}` per training plan §8 format. Legacy `docs/claude_task_progress.*` left untouched as historical.
- T0.4: added training runtime ignore patterns to `.gitignore` (`runs/`, `artifacts/`, `checkpoints/`, `data/`, `.cache/`, `*.wav`, `*.flac`, `*.mp3`, `*.m4a`, `*.pt`, `*.pth`, `*.ckpt`, `*.onnx`). No duplicates of existing rules; source, configs, docs, plans, and trackers remain trackable.
- T0.5: minimal Slurm gate job submitted through the committed wrapper and completed cleanly. Job `2125754` ran on `aisurrey01.surrey.ac.uk`, sacct state `COMPLETED`, exit code `0:0`. Output `/mnt/fast/nobackup/scratch4weeks/gb0048/asr_enhancement_training/logs/asr_t0_minimal_2125754.out` reports Python `3.10.13` and platform `Linux-5.14.0-427.42.1.el9_4.x86_64-x86_64-with-glibc2.31` from inside the Apptainer container; stderr `…2125754.err` carries the expected `WARNING: Not mounting current directory: user bind control is disabled by system administrator` (already encoded in CLAUDE.md §8 constraint 8). The Cut T0 gate is complete.
- T1.1: Apptainer environment configured. Image `/mnt/fast/nobackup/users/gb0048/opro2/pytorch_2.1_cuda12.sif` (~3.22 GiB) confirmed readable from datamove1 and from the Slurm execution context (re-using T0.5 job `2125754` evidence on `aisurrey01.surrey.ac.uk`). Python `3.10.13` inside the container (mismatch with plan §5 nominal 3.11 recorded; acceptance gated on T1.2 dependency imports). `slurm/templates/apptainer_job_template.job` already encodes the required absolute-path, `--env`-only, no-`--bind`, no-`--pwd`, no-`--nv` pattern; no new T1.1 probe job submitted; no venv-based training execution path introduced. YAML drift on `current_cut`/`current_phase` (T0/0 → T1/1) corrected as part of this closure.
- T1.2: training dependencies installed into an external prefix (`$TRAIN_ROOT/python_env/site-packages-py310`), consumed at runtime via `PYTHONPATH=$REPO:$PREFIX` with `PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1` and `python3 -s` to keep `~/.local` out of the import path. PyTorch 2.1.0, torchaudio 2.1.0 and numpy 1.26.0 remain image-resident under `/opt/conda` (not reinstalled, not shadowed). All required project modules import from the live repo; `openai-whisper`, all pyproject deps, and the audio IO stack import from the prefix. Python `3.10.13` accepted as the runtime gate. No `requirements.lock.x86_64` generated. No venv-based Slurm execution path introduced.
- T1.3: audio processing gate job passed. Synthetic 2-second 440 Hz WAV generated, processed through `libs.audio_pipeline.pipeline.apply_preset("denoise")` (high-pass filter + gain normalization), output validated. Job `2125808` ran on `aisurrey03.surrey.ac.uk`, sacct state `COMPLETED`, exit code `0:0`. Output peak `0.950012` (target 0.95). `libs.audio_pipeline.pipeline` resolved from REPO; `numpy` from `/opt/conda`; `scipy` and `soundfile` from PREFIX. `PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1` enforced; `site.ENABLE_USER_SITE=False`; no user-local module paths detected. Cut T1 gate complete.

## Current blocker

None. Cut T0 (datamove1 bootstrap) is complete; T1.1 (Apptainer environment), T1.2 (training dependencies), and T1.3 (audio processing gate) are complete. Cut T1 gate closed.

## T0.5 closure evidence (2026-05-01)

Submitted through the committed wrapper from datamove1:

```bash
./slurm/tools/on_submit.sh sbatch /mnt/fast/nobackup/users/gb0048/asr_enhancement/slurm/jobs/t0_minimal_job.sh
```

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Job ID | `2125754` |
| sacct state | `COMPLETED` |
| Exit code | `0:0` |
| Execution node | `aisurrey01.surrey.ac.uk` |
| Output log | `/mnt/fast/nobackup/scratch4weeks/gb0048/asr_enhancement_training/logs/asr_t0_minimal_2125754.out` |
| Error log | `/mnt/fast/nobackup/scratch4weeks/gb0048/asr_enhancement_training/logs/asr_t0_minimal_2125754.err` |
| Python (in Apptainer) | `3.10.13` |
| Platform (in Apptainer) | `Linux-5.14.0-427.42.1.el9_4.x86_64-x86_64-with-glibc2.31` |
| Apptainer warning (stderr) | `WARNING: Not mounting current directory: user bind control is disabled by system administrator` |

The expected cwd-bind warning is already encoded as a hard constraint in CLAUDE.md §8 (item 8) and reflected in `slurm/jobs/t0_minimal_job.sh` and `slurm/templates/apptainer_job_template.job`, so all training jobs must continue to use absolute paths.

## T1.1 closure evidence (2026-05-01)

T1.1 closes by recording the Apptainer environment already exercised by T0.5 job `2125754`; no new Slurm job was submitted. Raw logs from that job were re-read end-to-end before this closure; all claims below come from the on-disk log content, not from prior tracker text.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Apptainer image | `/mnt/fast/nobackup/users/gb0048/opro2/pytorch_2.1_cuda12.sif` |
| Image size | `3459866624` bytes (~3.22 GiB) |
| Image host mtime | `2026-01-15T21:22:00` |
| Readable from datamove1 | yes (`ls -la` on the login node) |
| Readable from Slurm execution context | yes (T0.5 job `2125754` ran `apptainer exec` against this exact path on `aisurrey01.surrey.ac.uk`) |
| Apptainer required for Slurm Python jobs | yes (single execution mode; no venv-based training path introduced) |
| Python inside container | `3.10.13 (main, Sep 11 2023, 13:44:35) [GCC 11.2.0]` |
| Platform inside container | `Linux-5.14.0-427.42.1.el9_4.x86_64-x86_64-with-glibc2.31` |
| Python version nominal (plan §5) | `3.11` |
| Python version mismatch | recorded; conditionally accepted, gated on T1.2 dependency import success inside the same container (plan §11 T1.1 decision rule 4) |
| Reusable Slurm template | `slurm/templates/apptainer_job_template.job` — already sufficient (absolute paths, `--env` exports, no `--bind`/`--pwd`/`--nv`); not modified |
| New T1.1 probe job | not required; T0.5 evidence covers all T1.1 “done when” criteria |
| Source evidence (stdout) | `/mnt/fast/nobackup/scratch4weeks/gb0048/asr_enhancement_training/logs/asr_t0_minimal_2125754.out` |
| Source evidence (stderr) | `/mnt/fast/nobackup/scratch4weeks/gb0048/asr_enhancement_training/logs/asr_t0_minimal_2125754.err` |

Raw T0.5 log excerpts re-confirmed in this closure:

- stdout line 5: `Container: /mnt/fast/nobackup/users/gb0048/opro2/pytorch_2.1_cuda12.sif`
- stdout lines 14–16: `--- Python version (inside Apptainer) ---` / `Python: 3.10.13 (main, Sep 11 2023, 13:44:35) [GCC 11.2.0]` / `Platform: Linux-5.14.0-427.42.1.el9_4.x86_64-x86_64-with-glibc2.31`
- stdout line 18: `=== T0.5 minimal job complete ===` (clean exit; matches sacct `COMPLETED 0:0`)
- stderr lines 1–3: `INFO: Setting 'NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all' …`, `INFO: Setting --writable-tmpfs …`, `WARNING: Not mounting current directory: user bind control is disabled by system administrator`

## T1.2 closure evidence (2026-05-02)

Stage history:

| Stage | Job ID | sacct | Outcome | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Clean Stage A (probe) | `2125796` | `COMPLETED 0:0` | accepted | First Stage A (`2125795`) was rejected because `~/.local` was satisfying torch/torchaudio/scipy/soundfile inside the container; ran clean with `--env PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1` and `python3 -s`. |
| Stage B+C attempt 1 | `2125798` | `FAILED 7:0` | rejected | `pip install --target --constraint torch==2.1.0` only **pinned** torch — pip still installed it (and numpy 2.2.6, ~5 GiB of CUDA wheels) into `$PREFIX`. Bash pre-Stage-C guard tripped with `BLOCKER: torch_shadowed_in_prefix`. Contaminated `$PREFIX` and `cache/pip` were removed (guarded `rm -rf` of those exact paths only) before retry. |
| Stage B+C retry  | `2125804` | `COMPLETED 0:0` | accepted | Strategy switched to: clean dry-run (no `--target`, sees `/opt/conda`) → forbidden-stack guard on the dry-run report → `pip install --target --no-deps -r resolved_set`. Resolved set: 69 distributions, none in the forbidden set (`torch torchaudio torchvision torchtext numpy triton nvidia-*`). |

Exact pip install command (verbatim, from the recorded cmd file):

```text
python3 -s -m pip install --no-warn-script-location --target /mnt/fast/nobackup/scratch4weeks/gb0048/asr_enhancement_training/python_env/site-packages-py310 --cache-dir /mnt/fast/nobackup/scratch4weeks/gb0048/asr_enhancement_training/cache/pip --no-deps -r /mnt/fast/nobackup/scratch4weeks/gb0048/asr_enhancement_training/artifacts/t1_2_resolved_install_set_2125804.txt
```

Runtime discipline carried forward (every later T1.x Apptainer call must keep these):

- `--env PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1`
- `python3 -s`
- `PYTHONPATH=$REPO:$PREFIX`

Origin assertions (from `t1_2_verify_2125804.json` `origin_assertions`):

- `all_libs_under_repo`: `true` (every `libs.*` resolved under `$REPO`)
- `no_project_dirs_in_prefix`: `true` (the third-party `alembic` distribution in `$PREFIX` is not a project shadow — the repo's `alembic/` has no `__init__.py`; the probe now requires `$REPO/<name>/__init__.py` before flagging)
- `torch_not_in_prefix`: `true`
- `torchaudio_not_in_prefix`: `true`
- `numpy_not_in_prefix`: `true`
- `any_user_local_module_paths_detected`: `false`

Resolved versions (image-resident under `/opt/conda` ↦ `IMG`; external prefix ↦ `PREFIX`):

| Package | Version | Origin |
|---|---|---|
| torch | 2.1.0 | IMG |
| torchaudio | 2.1.0 | IMG |
| numpy | 1.26.0 | IMG |
| scipy | 1.15.3 | PREFIX |
| soundfile | 0.13.1 | PREFIX |
| openai-whisper (`whisper`) | 20250625 | PREFIX |
| fastapi | 0.136.1 | PREFIX |
| celery | 5.6.3 | PREFIX |
| sqlalchemy | 2.0.49 | PREFIX |
| pydantic | 2.13.3 | PREFIX |
| pydantic-settings | 2.14.0 | PREFIX |
| pip | 23.2.1 | IMG |

Torch CUDA fields (CPU verify node, expected): `torch.version.cuda = 12.1`, `torch.cuda.is_available() = False`. GPU not required for T1.2.

Project module imports verified (all `libs.*`, all resolving under `$REPO`):

- required: `libs.asr_adapter`, `libs.asr_adapter.factory`, `libs.audio_pipeline`, `libs.audio_pipeline.pipeline`, `libs.common`, `libs.common.settings`, `libs.observability`, `libs.observability.logging`
- optional (also imported successfully): `libs.asr_adapter.assemblyai`, `libs.common.db`, `libs.common.models`, `libs.common.storage`, `libs.observability.metrics`, `libs.observability.tracing`

`Settings()` is **not** instantiated; `services.api.app.main` is **not** imported. T1.2 is an import gate, not an application startup test.

Python 3.10.13 vs nominal 3.11 verdict: **accepted** because every required import succeeded inside the same Apptainer container with user-site disabled. `pyproject.toml` declares `requires-python = ">=3.9"`.

Lock file: `requirements.lock.x86_64` was absent and unused; T1.2 did **not** generate it (deferred per explicit instruction). The exact pip install command and the resolved install set file are the reproducibility evidence.
