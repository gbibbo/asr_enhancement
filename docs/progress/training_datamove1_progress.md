# Training Task Progress

Branch: feature/training-datamove1-v1
Integration branch: demo-rp5-v1
Current cut: T1 (T0 gate complete)
Current phase: Phase 1
Current task: Task T1.1

## Completed

- T0.1: inspected datamove1 repository state. Repo root `/mnt/fast/nobackup/users/gb0048/asr_enhancement`, remote `git@github.com:gbibbo/asr_enhancement.git`, working tree clean, branch on `feature/training-datamove1-v1`.
- T0.2: training Claude profile activated on `feature/training-datamove1-v1` (commit `243ed48`). Root `CLAUDE.md` mirrors `docs/profiles/CLAUDE.training.md`; `.gitattributes` declares `CLAUDE.md merge=ours`; local `merge.ours.driver` configured to `true`.
- T0.3: created independent training trackers `docs/progress/training_datamove1_progress.{md,yaml}` per training plan §8 format. Legacy `docs/claude_task_progress.*` left untouched as historical.
- T0.4: added training runtime ignore patterns to `.gitignore` (`runs/`, `artifacts/`, `checkpoints/`, `data/`, `.cache/`, `*.wav`, `*.flac`, `*.mp3`, `*.m4a`, `*.pt`, `*.pth`, `*.ckpt`, `*.onnx`). No duplicates of existing rules; source, configs, docs, plans, and trackers remain trackable.
- T0.5: minimal Slurm gate job submitted through the committed wrapper and completed cleanly. Job `2125754` ran on `aisurrey01.surrey.ac.uk`, sacct state `COMPLETED`, exit code `0:0`. Output `/mnt/fast/nobackup/scratch4weeks/gb0048/asr_enhancement_training/logs/asr_t0_minimal_2125754.out` reports Python `3.10.13` and platform `Linux-5.14.0-427.42.1.el9_4.x86_64-x86_64-with-glibc2.31` from inside the Apptainer container; stderr `…2125754.err` carries the expected `WARNING: Not mounting current directory: user bind control is disabled by system administrator` (already encoded in CLAUDE.md §8 constraint 8). The Cut T0 gate is complete.

## Current blocker

None. Cut T0 (datamove1 bootstrap) is complete.

## T0.5 closure evidence (2026-05-01)

Submitted through the committed wrapper from datamove1:

```bash
./slurm/tools/on_submit.sh sbatch /mnt/fast/nobackup/users/gb0048/asr_enhancement/slurm/jobs/t0_minimal_job.sh
```

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Job ID | `2125754` |
| sacct state | `COMPLETED` |
| Exit code | `0:0` |
| Execution node | `aisurrey01.surrey.ac.uk` |
| Output log | `/mnt/fast/nobackup/scratch4weeks/gb0048/asr_enhancement_training/logs/asr_t0_minimal_2125754.out` |
| Error log | `/mnt/fast/nobackup/scratch4weeks/gb0048/asr_enhancement_training/logs/asr_t0_minimal_2125754.err` |
| Python (in Apptainer) | `3.10.13` |
| Platform (in Apptainer) | `Linux-5.14.0-427.42.1.el9_4.x86_64-x86_64-with-glibc2.31` |
| Apptainer warning (stderr) | `WARNING: Not mounting current directory: user bind control is disabled by system administrator` |

The expected cwd-bind warning is already encoded as a hard constraint in CLAUDE.md §8 (item 8) and reflected in `slurm/jobs/t0_minimal_job.sh` and `slurm/templates/apptainer_job_template.job`, so all training jobs must continue to use absolute paths.

## Sync status

Last synced from demo-rp5-v1: 2026-05-01 (T0.2 commit `243ed48`, 1 ahead / 0 behind).

## Next task

Task T1.1. Configure required Apptainer environment.
