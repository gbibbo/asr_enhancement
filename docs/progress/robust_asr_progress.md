# Robust ASR LoRA Router — Progress

Project: robust_asr_lora_router
Branch: feature/robust-asr-lora-router-datamove1-v1
Status: IN_PROGRESS

## Current state

- Phase: P0 (Bootstrap and skeleton)
- Current task: P0.3 (HALTED — must be rerun after image fix)
- Last completed: P0.2 (asset inventory, reuse policy, touch policy, report shape validator)
- Active markers: BLOCKED_RUNTIME
- Blocked: true
- Blocker: Apptainer image provides Python 3.10.13 (Decision rule 2 requires 3.11) and ctranslate2/faster_whisper/pytest are not installed (Decision rule 4). Clear by rebuilding the image and rerunning P0.3.

## Completed tasks

- P0.0 PASS: Pre-bootstrap inventory (read-only, no commit)
- P0.1 PASS: Branch created, profile installed, tracker initialized
- P0.2 PASS: Asset inventory, reuse policy, touch policy, validate_report_shape.py

## Scope changes

- P0.3 CHANGE_SCOPE applied: amended `configs/robust_asr/reuse_policy_v1.yaml`
  to authorize exec-only use of the Apptainer image (class=container_image,
  permitted_use=exec_only) and to make `slurm/jobs/**` writable for
  robust_asr `p<task_id>_*.sh` scripts (permitted_use=read_only_with_robust_asr_writes).
  current_task remains P0.3; last_completed_task remains P0.2.
- P0.3 CHANGE_SCOPE (Option A) applied: added a new robust_asr-specific
  Apptainer image path under `scratch4weeks/.../asr_enhancement_training/runtime/`
  to `configs/robust_asr/reuse_policy_v1.yaml`
  (class=container_image, permitted_use=exec_only, same allowed_tasks
  as `slurm/tools/**`) and a `data_root` parent row
  (`runtime/**`, permitted_use=read_write, allowed_tasks=[P0.3]) for
  the build outputs. The legacy image at `/mnt/fast/nobackup/users/gb0048/opro2/pytorch_2.1_cuda12.sif`
  is preserved untouched. `reports/robust_asr/touch_policy.md` extended
  with the P0.3 runtime remediation write paths. current_task remains
  P0.3, last_completed_task remains P0.2, BLOCKED_RUNTIME stays active,
  last_accepted_report_commit stays at 635a711.

## P0.3 first attempt (HALTED)

- Slurm job 2129637 ran in container; exit_code=1.
- Container Python 3.10.13 (must be 3.11) and missing imports
  ctranslate2/faster_whisper/pytest. Lightgbm and xgboost also missing
  (would have triggered ROUTER_IMPL_FALLBACK_SKLEARN, superseded by HALTED).
- Evidence committed at `reports/robust_asr/runtime_smoke.md`,
  `reports/robust_asr/task_reports/P0.3_runtime_smoke.md`,
  `artifacts/robust_asr/runtime_smoke/` (metadata + stdout + stderr).
- Awaiting orchestrator decision: rebuild image (likely a CHANGE_SCOPE
  if the new image lives at a different host path) and rerun P0.3.

## P0.3-rebuild sub-task (PASS — BLOCKED_RUNTIME still active)

- Slurm job 2129638 (attempt 1): FAILED 1:0 in 12 min — recipe quoting
  bug (`<X` interpreted as input redirect by dash inside `%post`).
  Fixed by single-quoting every `'>=…,<…'` pip spec in the recipe.
- Slurm job 2129639 (attempt 2): COMPLETED 0:0 in 8 min 39 s via
  `apptainer build --fakeroot` on aisurrey01. Image size 5.24 GB.
  Recipe `%test` block ran `Python 3.11.15` and
  `robust_asr runtime image v1 test PASS`.
- Image at the authorized path:
  `/mnt/fast/nobackup/scratch4weeks/gb0048/asr_enhancement_training/runtime/robust_asr_py311_cuda12.sif`
  sha256 `8db5364c7610496a33f1d6aa5677a5196460c6907b992b04560efbb7e4ce8713`
  recipe sha256 `e6e7f79bae25e8f6bf3726ab8024a75f4769ad0825eddc15f8b1e50ae377f63e`
- Legacy SIF at `/mnt/.../opro2/pytorch_2.1_cuda12.sif` untouched.
- Tracker: `tasks["P0.3-rebuild"]=PASS`,
  `artifacts.runtime_image_v1` populated,
  `tasks.P0.3.next_task=P0.3-rerun`. **BLOCKED_RUNTIME stays active**;
  `current_task` stays `P0.3`; `last_completed_task` stays `P0.2`;
  `state_transport.last_accepted_report_commit` stays `635a711...`

## Pending

- P0.3-rerun: rerun `slurm/jobs/p0_3_runtime_smoke.sh` against the new image to clear BLOCKED_RUNTIME
- P0.4: Runtime contract skeleton
- P0.5: Model card and router card templates
- P0 gate → P1 (schema, manifests, degradations)
- P1 → P2 (Whisper base baseline)
- P3 (LoRA smoke, Decision A)
- P4 (Full LoRA if Decision A PASS)
- P5 (AssemblyAI cache or BLOCKED_API)
- P6 (Oracle / selector evidence)
- P7 (Router or deterministic selector)
- P8 (System evaluation)
- P9 (Handoff package)
- P10 (Final reports and audit)
